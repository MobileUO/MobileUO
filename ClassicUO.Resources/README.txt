This project exists because we can't directly include embeddable files in Unity easily.

But we can include a dll of embeddable files. So this dll is added into the Unity assets folder so the embeds are accessible.

If you need to make any changes to .resx files, change them here, then build this project to generate a new dll file for Unity.
